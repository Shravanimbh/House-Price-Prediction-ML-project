#  House Price Prediction – Linear Regression ML Project

This project focuses on building a **Linear Regression** model to predict house prices based on various features like area, location, and number of rooms. It is a classic supervised machine learning problem that demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, and result visualization using regression techniques.

## 📊 Problem Statement

Predict the **price of a house** based on features.

---

## 🧠 ML Approach

- Used **Linear Regression** from `scikit-learn`.
- Performed data cleaning and preprocessing using Pandas.
- Split the dataset into training and test sets.
- Evaluated performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score.
